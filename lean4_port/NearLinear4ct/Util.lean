/-- Proof-obligation assert. **The proof IS the assert**: for the `check_*`
lemmas, "success" is "no obligation fires and the run completes". Never use
bare `panic!` for a proof obligation -- it prints but **continues with exit
code 0**, so a swallowed failure would read as a passed proof; `throw`
propagates to `main` and exits non-zero. -/

/-- Disjoint-set forest (union-find) without path compression or union-by-rank,
matching the C++ `Unionfind`.

The C++ marks a root with `parents[x] < 0` (value `-1`). Here a root is
`none`; an interior node is `some parent`. Mutating operations return an updated
`Unionfind` (the underlying `Array.set` is in-place when uniquely referenced). -/

  n : Nat
  parents : Array (Option Nat)
  /-- One slot per node, and every parent pointer lands in range: a
  `Unionfind` is structurally well-formed by construction (erased at
  runtime). Acyclicity is *not* carried here -- that stays a proof-side
  invariant (`Unionfind.WF`). -/

/-- Follow parent pointers from `x` for at most `fuel` steps. The range test
is the comparison `getElem!` would make anyway, minus its panic path: on any
real forest `unionfind_invariant` keeps every followed pointer in range, so
the `else` is dead code and every read is proof-carrying. -/

/-- Representative of `x`. The C++ recurses with no path compression, so this is
behaviourally identical on a well-formed forest. Total via a fuel bound of
`uf.n`: a well-formed parent chain visits distinct in-range nodes, so `n` steps
always reach a root (proved as `Unionfind.WF.root_spec` in `UtilProofs.lean`).

confirm we have not diverged from the reference. -/

on in-range inputs it never fires, so behaviour is unchanged. -/

/-! ### Parallel combinators (pure, `Task`-based, order-preserving)

A small vocabulary of order-preserving parallel patterns. Each spawns its work on
the `Task` scheduler and joins in index order, so the result is **identical to the
sequential version regardless of thread count** -- valid for a read-only `f` over
shared immutable data. The parallelism is wall-clock only; it never changes
results. Centralising the `Task` plumbing here means the parallelism is audited
once, and call sites read as the pattern they are (`parFilterMap`, `parFlatMap`). -/

/-- Parallel `Array.map` (≡ `xs.map f`, order-preserving). -/
def parMap (xs : Array α) (f : α → β) : Array β :=
  (xs.map (fun x => Task.spawn (fun _ => f x))).map (·.get)

/-- Parallel `Array.filterMap` (≡ `xs.filterMap f`): map in parallel, keep the
`some`s in order. -/
def parFilterMap (xs : Array α) (f : α → Option β) : Array β :=
  (parMap xs f).filterMap id

/-- Parallel flat-map (≡ `(xs.map f).flatten`): map each element to an array in
parallel, then concatenate in order. -/
def parFlatMap (xs : Array α) (f : α → Array β) : Array β :=
  (parMap xs f).flatten

/-- Map an `IO` action over `xs` in parallel, preserving order and re-raising the
first failure. Each `f x` is spawned with `IO.asTask`; results are joined in index
order. For independent IO (e.g. reading + parsing many files), this overlaps the
work across cores. -/
def parMapM (xs : Array α) (f : α → IO β) : IO (Array β) := do
  let tasks ← xs.mapM (fun x => IO.asTask (f x))
  tasks.mapM (fun t => IO.ofExcept t.get)

/-- Run `f` on every element in parallel and fail the whole computation if any
invocation fails. Each `f x` is spawned as a `Task`; we then join every task and
re-raise the first error -- so a failing `proofAssert` inside a worker aborts the
process with a non-zero exit. The closures only read shared immutable data (shared
by reference-counting, not copied), so results are thread-count independent. -/
def parForEach (xs : Array α) (f : α → IO Unit) : IO Unit := do
  let tasks ← xs.mapM (fun x => IO.asTask (f x))

/-- Load every regular file in `dir` whose extension matches `extension`
(e.g. `".rule"`), as `α`, **sorted by path**.

Ordering is observable (it defines the `combined_flag` rule order, see
`../FORMAT.md`), so we sort explicitly rather than rely on filesystem order.
`System.FilePath.extension` yields the suffix without the leading dot; we
normalise so callers can pass ".rule". -/
